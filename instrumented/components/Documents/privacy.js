        <h5>How do you get my consent?</h5>
        When you provide us with personal information to complete a
        registration, verify your identity or request a service, we imply that
        you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason
        only. If we ever ask for your personal information for a secondary
        reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your
        expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h4>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h4>
        We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to

      <p>
        <h4>SECTION 4 â€“ Database</h4>
        Our platform database is hosted with an online hosting platform (the
        Cloud) that allows us to provide services to you. Your data is stored
        through their data storage services and applications. We store your data
        on a secure server behind a firewall.

        <h4>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4>
        <p>
          In general, the third-party providers, if used, will only collect, use
          and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to
          perform the services they provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment
          gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own
          privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to
          provide to them for your purchase-related transactions if payment is
          ever required.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies
          so you can understand the manner in which your personal information
          will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that
          certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are
          located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you
          elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a
          third-party service provider, then your information may become subject
          to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or
          its facilities are located.

        follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately
        lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. If you provide
